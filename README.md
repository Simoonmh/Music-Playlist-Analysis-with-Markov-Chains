# Music-Playlist-Probability-Distribution-with-Markov-Chains
Given a certain playlist, the listening order of songs from Group i to Group j follow a certain probability distribution. Based on this, a Markov chain is constructed, and random walks of various lengths are conducted. Line graphs are generated to depict the probabilities of listening to songs from different groups.

The transition from Group i to Group j is given by the following probability distribution:

Based on this, a Markov chain is constructed and random walks of various lengths are conducted to observe the frequency and probabilities obtained for each group from the Markov chain.
